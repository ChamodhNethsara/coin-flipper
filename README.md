# coin-flipper

Do you want to flip a coin?

Then get a coin and flip!


But what if you want to flip a coin 1000000 times and calcualte the possibillity of getting heads???

Then my fun project coin flipper is for you.


Coin flipper is written in Python and used Tkinter to have a simple graphical user interface.
If you run this, you will be able to see how the theory of large numbers works practically.


Hope you enjoy it.
